# Calculator App

This repository contains a simple calculator web application built using Vue.js. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports percentage calculations and changing between two themes.

## Technologies Used

### Vue.js
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It's lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for single-page applications like this calculator. Vue.js provides features like data binding and components, which simplify the development process and enhance the maintainability of the code.



## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the calculator.
- **Percentage Calculation**: The calculator allows users to calculate percentages of numbers.
- **Toggle Sign**: Users can toggle the sign of the current operand (+/-).
- **Theme Switching**: The calculator offers two themes, which users can switch between by toggling a checkbox. The themes change the color scheme of the calculator for better user experience.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply click on the buttons to input numbers and perform operations. The display screen will show the current operand and result of calculations. Use the "C" button to clear the display and start a new calculation. Toggle the sign of the current operand using the "+/-" button. Click on the percentage button to calculate percentages. You can switch between themes by toggling the checkbox labeled "Theme 1/Theme 2".

## Getting Started

To run the calculator locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. cd to hello-world
4. run npm run serve
5. Start using the calculator!

Alternatively, you can deploy the calculator to a web hosting service to make it accessible online.

### Note: This project utilizes Vue.js version 2.x for front-end development
